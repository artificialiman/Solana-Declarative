# SolD Language - Secure Token Launches Made Simple

![SolD Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200/667eea/ffffff?text=SolD%20-%20Blockchain%20Safety%20Language)

**SolD** is a declarative language that compiles to bulletproof Solana smart contracts. Think "markup for blockchain" - simple syntax, maximum security.

## 🎯 What SolD Solves

**The Problem:** 90% of token launches are rug pulls. Complex smart contract development creates security holes.

**The Solution:** Declarative syntax with built-in safety constraints that make rug pulls impossible.

```sold
DEVNET

<token name="SafeCoin" symbol="SAFE" supply="1000000" />
<timelock duration="100d" />
<insurance wallets=["emergency_wallet"] limit="5" />
<fees recipient="GR8TuDpbnDvuLzW4JBCLjbeLvGFs1p21XBytLx6rA7XD" launch="0.02" />
```

This 4-line SolD program compiles to 650+ lines of secure Anchor/Rust code with:
- ✅ **100-day minimum timelock** (eliminates fast rug pulls)
- ✅ **AI-powered fraud detection** (trained on rug pull patterns)
- ✅ **Insurance wallet limits** (max 50% emergency withdrawals)
- ✅ **Automated fee collection** (sustainable ecosystem funding)

## 🚀 Quick Start Demo

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### One-Command Demo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sold-lang
cd sold-lang
docker-compose up
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and start launching tokens safely!

## 📋 Testing Instructions (For Judges/Reviewers)

### Test Scenario 1: Basic Token Launch
1. **Open the web interface** → http://localhost:3000
2. **Use the default example** (already loaded)
3. **Click "Validate"** → Should show green success with fee calculation
4. **Click "Launch Token"** → Watch the 4-step process complete
5. **Expected Result:** 
   - Fraud score < 0.3 (low risk)
   - Generated Anchor program with proper safety constraints
   - Fee calculation: 0.02 SOL (base + 1 insurance wallet)

### Test Scenario 2: High-Risk Launch (Should Fail)
1. **Load the "Basic Token" template**
2. **Modify to suspicious parameters:**
   ```sold
   DEVNET
   
   <token name="SCAM_COIN" symbol="SCAM" supply="999999999999" />
   <timelock duration="1h" />
   <insurance wallets=["fake1", "fake2", "fake3", "fake4", "fake5"] limit="50" />
   <fees recipient="GR8TuDpbnDvuLzW4JBCLjbeLvGFs1p21XBytLx6rA7XD" launch="0.06" />
   ```
3. **Click "Validate"** → Should FAIL with errors:
   - "Timelock duration must be at least 100 days"
   - High fraud score (>0.8)
4. **Expected Result:** Launch rejected for safety

### Test Scenario 3: DeFi Project Template
1. **Click "DeFi Project" template**
2. **Validate** → Should pass with medium fraud score
3. **Note the complexity:** 
   - Multiple insurance wallets
   - Logo NFT support
   - USDC transfers
   - Relock capability
4. **Expected Result:** 
   - Fee: 0.035 SOL (base + 1 insurance + logo)
   - Generated program includes all features

### Test Scenario 4: API Testing
```bash
# Test validation endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"soldCode": "DEVNET\n\n<token name=\"Test\" symbol=\"TST\" supply=\"1000\" />\n<timelock duration=\"100d\" />\n<fees recipient=\"GR8TuDpbnDvuLzW4JBCLjbeLvGFs1p21XBytLx6rA7XD\" launch=\"0.01\" />"}'

# Expected: {"valid": true, "config": {...}, "estimatedFee": 0.01}

# Test fee calculation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/calculate-fee \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"insuranceWallets": ["wallet1", "wallet2"], "hasLogo": true}'

# Expected: {"total": 0.035, "breakdown": {...}}
```

### Test Scenario 5: Code Generation Verification
1. **Launch any token successfully**
2. **Check generated files:** `temp/compile_[timestamp]/src/lib.rs`
3. **Verify Anchor code contains:**
   - `MIN_TIMELOCK_DURATION = 8_640_000` (100 days)
   - Fee recipient hardcoded to `GR8TuDpbnDvuLzW4JBCLjbeLvGFs1p21XBytLx6rA7XD`
   - Insurance withdrawal limits enforced
   - Fraud score tracking

### Components:
- **🔍 SolD Parser** (TypeScript) - Converts SolD syntax to structured config
- **🤖 AI Fraud Engine** (Python/FastAPI) - Analyzes wallets for rug pull patterns  
- **⚙️ Anchor Compiler** (Rust) - Generates bulletproof smart contracts
- **🌐 API Gateway** (Node.js) - Orchestrates the entire pipeline
- **🖥️ Web Interface** (HTML/JS) - User-friendly token launch experience

## 📖 SolD Language Reference

### Syntax (8 Primitives)
```sold
NETWORK  # DEVNET | TESTNET | MAINNET

<token name="string" symbol="string" supply="number" />
<logo nft="solana_address" />
<timelock duration="100d" wallets=["wallet1", "wallet2"] />
<insurance wallets=["emergency"] limit="5" />
<transfer sol="amount" usdc="amount" />
<relock duration="200d" escrow="solana_address" />
<fees recipient="solana_address" launch="0.02" trading="0.00001" />
```

### Safety Constraints (Enforced by Compiler)
- ⏰ **Minimum timelock: 100 days** (cannot be bypassed)
- 🏦 **Maximum insurance limit: 50%** (prevents total draining)  
- 👥 **Maximum insurance wallets: 10** (prevents fake decentralization)
- 💰 **Fee recipient: Fixed address** (sustainable ecosystem funding)
- 📊 **Supply limit: u64 max** (same as SOL native token)

## 🧪 Development Setup

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sold-lang
cd sold-lang

# Install dependencies
npm install          # Parser & API
pip install -r requirements.txt  # AI Engine
anchor build         # Anchor Program

# Start services
npm run dev:parser   # Port 3001
python ai-engine/main.py  # Port 8000  
npm run dev:api      # Port 3000
```

## 💰 Economic Model

### Fee Structure (All fees → `GR8TuDpbnDvuLzW4JBCLjbeLvGFs1p21XBytLx6rA7XD`)
```
Base Launch Fee:     0.01 SOL
Insurance Fee:       0.01 SOL × number_of_insurance_wallets  
Logo NFT Fee:        0.005 SOL (optional)
Relock Fee:          0.02 SOL (when timelock expires)
Trading Fee:         0.00001 SOL (2× Solana base fee)

Example Calculation:
- Basic launch: 0.01 SOL
- With 2 insurance wallets: 0.01 + (0.01×2) = 0.03 SOL  
- With logo: 0.03 + 0.005 = 0.035 SOL
```

### Revenue Sustainability
- **100 launches/month** → ~3 SOL revenue → Funds AI infrastructure
- **1,000 launches/month** → ~30 SOL revenue → Full development team
- **10,000 launches/month** → ~300 SOL revenue → Market leadership
